This is a very basic Alexa Skill for giving you cat facts. I use my Alexa daily and thought it would be fun to go through the tutorial and make a skill. Plus Amazon was giving away a free t-shirt for publishing a skill. wooo...FREE t-shirt!
You can find the skill => [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XJ86R5C/ref=syps?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1490146652&sr=1-1&keywords=Cat+Facts) <=
